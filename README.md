# CS14003 - Decision Tree Analysis Project

**Course:** Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals  
**Course Code:** CS14003  
**Time Period:** 07/06/2025 - 26/06/2025

## Project Description

This project implements and analyzes decision tree algorithms for classification tasks using different datasets. Our team explores the application of decision trees to healthcare data (Heart Disease), ecological data (Palmer Penguins), and an additional dataset to demonstrate the versatility of this machine learning technique.

The project aims to:
1. Prepare and preprocess diverse datasets for decision tree analysis
2. Implement decision tree algorithms from scratch and using existing libraries
3. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
4. Visualize decision trees to improve interpretability of results
5. Compare outcomes across different datasets to identify strengths and limitations

Through this work, we demonstrate practical applications of decision trees in solving real-world classification problems.
